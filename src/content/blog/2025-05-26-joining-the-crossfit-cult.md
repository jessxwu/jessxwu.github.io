I accidentally fell into distance running again after a sleepless flight to San Francisco, where I ran 18km because I didn't realize how big the Valley was... and was trying to run to the water (and clear my head after all this Trump stuff).

I'm still quite sad that The Rogue Room closed. I miss the community and I miss all my weird classes, I miss yoga, and I miss calisthenics. I haven't found the right fit yet since life was too full on to warrant myself signing up for something new. Now that I've signed up for the benefits and such, going to explore what works, although my travel schedule is intense again.

Cycling a lot again. I commute by bike - I probably average 5 hours a week getting around. When I race to work, it can be 18 minutes with low traffic. 

I tried a cool Rings class that Sammy taught at Waking Life 3 months ago and it was super cool. I would love to do 3 months dedicated to rings and learn all the major movements - it looks so cool.
Um, also want to get into Crossfit and some cold plunging... did I mention I miss yoga? 

I've given up on swimming, but will still keep up calisthenics, jump rope, and hope to do badminton maybe twice a month. 

I reached out to a couple of friends I used to run with and lost in touch with, and it's such a good way to stay connected. It's also amazing to see how much they progressed since (while I stagnated lol). I actually know so many people that do this kind of stuff - if only my body could keep up. Trying to do consistent sports massages now - hoping that will do something. 

Also realised handstands are easier on the beach!
