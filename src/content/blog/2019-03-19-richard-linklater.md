A little bit I wrote on the Before Trilogy and relationships. This was a quick freewrite (10 mins). Unfinished.
 <hr align = "left" width="50%">

I watched *The Movie* last night. It was no stranger to me.

1.
He told me that it reminded him of us. With nonchalance, he told me it was the greatest love story ever committed to screen. We met not in a dissimilar circumstance, but we were not lovers like they were. I was intrigued by this, but we got caught up in the flurry of temptation and neglect, the push and pull that drives relationships into dust. I don’t remember the night we met as vividly as I think I should. Do all memories fade if you don’t commit them to paper? I didn’t write much then, I was too busy living. Maybe that’s the way it should be.

I remember my eyes wide and innocent, my heart a little devious… cautious but begging to be let out. I had been awake for over twenty hours at that point, but the body chugs on when the mind is alert. We talked for hours, letting each other slowly fall in love with each other as the sun rose. I lost myself in the chaotic, messy, dirty streets of Bangkok, but it felt so vivacious and full of life with every breath we gleaned. My brain was pushing forward with intensity, paving a slipshod road for foggy memories to form.

2. 
Dating him was like *The Movie*. He said this himself (in his dating profile). Maybe that's not very romantic. However, colour me intrigued. A self-fulfilling prophecy perhaps in that it was so short and fleeting. After we parted ways, I thought of Ethan Hawke in Before Sunset, how negative and pushy he was. So self-righteous and aggrandizing. I wonder sometimes the extent of how my perceptions of the world and myself would have changed (for better or for worse) if we dated for a longer time, as I was pretty impressionable at the time.

3. 
We spend a lot of time sitting next to big windows on moving trains with changing scenes, but we're often fixtated on our changing screens.
