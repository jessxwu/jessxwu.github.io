I got SO lucky, and with some help from friends (because I honestly think music ticketing IT infra is the worst in the world), I was able to snag a bunch of 10 pound tickets to the Lido shows in Viccy Park this June.

<hr align = "left" width="50%">

In the queue: 
- Massive Attack x Air (legit paid like 400 quid to see both of them last year, and nearly flew to BCN to see Air)... I can't beleive I snagged a pair of tickets for less than 20 quid. 
- Outbreak Fest - a true hardcore/punk fest, based out of Manchester that have added a date in London. I think Turnstile is one of the best punk bands to come out of the last decade and they will be so fun to see. Their new EP is decent too, I've been spinning it and seems like it'll come out before the show. 
  - I ordered a Deathconsciousness tee because I'm so excited to see Have a Nice Life's set. Heard they make some of their stuff a bit more upbeat and heavy for live shows, which is the hope!
  I've been to my fair share of post-rock shows nearly falling asleep standing (sorry GY!BE...) but also ones that have been amazing. Here's hoping!
  - I'm not that familiar with a lot of the other bands, so I'm listening. Also keen to see Sunny Day Real Estate. Pillars is such a perfect song. 
- Jamie xx and friends. Including Romy (why can't they just play together), Panda Bear, and Skrillex (interesting...)
- Kazy Lambist - what is it about french electronica? so dope! will be so funky and fun and dancey!
- Have been watching the Death in Vegas quietly release mixes again - and he's playing his first show in London since 2018! Literally flying back from Cannes early to see his set at EarTH (!!)
- Glastonbury!
- Berlin... some klubnacht hopefully :) 

Missing: Nine Inch Nails (big tear) because I'll be in Cannes. I'm selling those tickets and London Grammar (since they were 10 pounds too, probably for a profit). Might see if I can see them in Paris or something later in the European tour, but this is an expensive adventure.
