A little poem about the Pixies. They used to be my favourite band. If you're a huge Pixies fan, you'll see it's littered with tons of references, stylistically, lyrically, maybe about them selling out... etcetera. I think I threw in a Smiths and Kyuss reference in too, just to round out some of my favourite bands. It's written in a style I don't typically adopt - silly and with inconsistent rhyme. I do typically write poetry but don’t incorporate rhyme this way.

I was inspired by a Pixies song playing in the background when I had no idea what to do with this prompt. Non-edited and nonsensical.
<hr align = "left" width="50%">

I can’t go on.<br>
That’s the problem with this song.<br>
It’s the - <br>
Loud,<br>
Quiet,<br>
Loud,<br>
that I’ve fallen out of love with.

Hip hip!<br>
The riff comes down loud and fast.<br>
Menacing, in fact.<br>
To play with words and words are play;<br>
But the trombone is here to stay.<br>
He is a palace or shrine.<br>
But it’s simply a palace of brine.<br>
Shrimp and little ones.<br>
Little fish, you’re coming undone.

Stop. <br>
Her singing, ghastly and it comes from over there.<br>
Puppet, ventriloquist playing.<br>
Everything is shrill in my right ear.<br>
I break my neck with a whirl, it cracks.<br>
Still waiting for the screech of the sax.<br>
The asinine,<br>
It doesn’t need to make sense.<br>

A gruffer male voice.<br>
Keep on asking, those Five Whys?<br>
A playful bass ball bounces and rolls down the aisle.<br>
It’s met its match with a brand new tune.<br>
We can always try this for a little while. <br>
It never comes.

Slicing up eyeballs.<br>
Relegated to nightmare scenes in my youth.<br>
Is something I would now emblazon on my forearm.<br>
Carved in with a fountain pen in a southern drawl.<br>
I told myself it symbolized strength and charm.<br>
Really, it’s just pretension and a vague reference to a film I’d never understood.<br>
Pretty uncouth.

A little bit of Spanish.<br>
Sprinkle it through and wash it up.<br>
They’re all washed up.<br>
And now they’re out.<br>
It’s okay; genius strikes out.<br>
The guitar is out of tune.<br>
A playful lick, curved upwards.

Cymbals clang, like<br>
Monkey.<br>
Like Donkey.<br>
She’s real okay.<br>
Keep on shouting;<br>
It’s lively. Not blithely.<br>
And I’ll have to keep you in my stacks.<br>
This is my last paycheque.
