title: Painful by Yo La Tengo
excerpt: A very short album review, unfinished. I was obsessed with this album, fell in love with indie darlings Yo La Tengo this summer. I've been meaning to finish this off. I think this was written spontaneously, in little time (ten mins or so) - some unplanned combustion of a love song expressing my passion and adoration for this album. Originally rife with stylization errors so it's a bit shoddy and disorganized.

A very short album review, unfinished. I was obsessed with this album, fell in love with indie darlings Yo La Tengo this summer. I've been meaning to finish this off.

It doesn’t come easy; for albums to strike you so intensely. I love it. it’s one of my favourite feelings. I fall in love with songs here and there. I become enamoured with the eccentricity of an artist and play to death three or four singles. But for a full album to grip me, grab me by my lapel and violently shake me for weeks on weeks; it’s such a fantastic feeling.

I remember being blown away by Kyuss’ Welcome to Sky Valley (or self-titled, whatever) during exam week and being utterly shocked at how perfect the album was. I was in absolute awe.

Maybe it’s not quite yet at perfection; but this album is really hitting the spot right now. There’s a place for every track in this album, nestled imperfectly against each other, mushing into each other, gently fading and lapping into the next. It might also be that I recently turned on Spotify’s crossfade option, but let's pretend.

Those deep, sexy basslines of “Nowhere Near” are lulling, but comforting. honey slowly permeating your tongue, slowly but surely trickling its way down your throat and into the deep of your belly. Things will be alright, and you look onwards in the deep blue dark of the sky, which is really only a mirage. You know it’s cause blue light is the shortest wavelength and this is what we see; but really, what’s out there? Just you and the space in front of you. The end of the song strums with more conviction, Ira’s twangy guitar like a young boy finally learning to stand up for himself at once. It’s not bold or challenging; but it tells you change is imminent. You’re better for it. And this song.

The erraticness of the organ urgently screaming while the melodies just spiral and haze in a dreamlike fashion in "Sudden Organ" is perfect. "Sudden Organ" is the perfect name for this song.
