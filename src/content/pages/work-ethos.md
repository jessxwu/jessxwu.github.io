It feels like we're all reaching for the perfect job. Sometimes it feels like it meshes perfectly for you.
Sometimes it doesn't.

Do we trust Gallup? The most recent "State of the Global Workplace" report (2024)
Apparently, 60% of people globally are emotionally detached at work and 19% are miserable.

A staggering 90 per cent of UK employees lack enthusiasm for their jobs.
The UK rate of engagement at work (10%) remains one of the lowest in Europe, ranking near the bottom among peer countries (33 out of 38), with countries such as the US reporting triple the number of engaged employees (31%). The dissatisfied feeling among workers is not unique to the UK, with just 13% across Europe feeling engaged at work, with the lowest rates of engagement reported in France (7%) and Italy (5%). 

Once you break the 'colleague' barrier, talks about this at work, and I feel like I'm living in the Truman Show sometimes. 
But some people genuinely love their jobs, and my boyfriend is one person in this camp.

I was recently listening to a podcast, where beyond disengagement,


## Team and Value Alignment

Quite important here - is to work in a team whose values align with my own.
If I had to encapsulate my approach to work in one phrase: I care deeply (and a lot).
I care about the work that I do, the people I work with, and ultimately in doing my job well (and better than before). I have realized that it’s fundamental for me to work in a place where the people around me operate with the same commitment of mutual caring and alignment to producing high-calibre impactful work. This, to me, is the foundation of building and maintaining trust, empathy, open communication, and all these positive externalities that produce great outcomes and nurture continuous improvement.

Value alignment is essential for me so I can be my authentic self. This means that I can produce the best work I can, continue to grow in my own career and develop my skillset as a marketer, and to be an all-around happy person.

How do I determine this? One thing that stands out to me is when researching the company - looking for the volume and the transparency of the literature they have on how they think and work.

When gauging a sense of company culture, I often only have a few kernels of canned manifesto or purpose statement to base my impression on. This is different for start-ups and smaller companies, but an alignment with certain missions like the Founder Promise are big for me.

For larger enterprise companies, I hope that there is a treasure trove of content on the blog (and a wealth of podcasts!) that speak directly to your philosophy, and the real decisions you’ve made that reflect that – e.g. embedded in the product design, people operations (personal projects, async work culture), and corporate strategy (fully bootstrapped journey and no-exit ethos), among others. 

Look for companies that are exceptions in many ways, look for who they hire and their commitment to quality people. These actions demonstrate to me your true commitment of keeping to and genuinely living those core values. It gives me the confidence and assurance that this is a culture that I would feel comfortable in and would love to be a part of. 

## The JD has flex

(3) The job description feels like a great match for my skill set and work superpowers.
The JD is not minutely explicit or technical, and I presume intentionally so, in that it puts more significance on having the specific working styles and values that Doist is looking for.

It also helps paint a picture of the versatility and adaptability required to succeed in this role, and the reality of being nimble and resourceful whilst ‘wearing many hats’. These are all elements that make up my personal identity and work style. 

## The JD has flex
Here are a few notes that speak to my work ethos (and the skills I excel at):
• I do notionally believe that at its core, marketing is about creating a compelling narrative and telling a story. I’m a strong writer (written, long-form communication is my superpower) and am adept at crafting these stories and translating them into a cohesive integrated marketing strategy.

• As I have high expectations for myself, I also have high expectations for my team. I value empathic leadership and take pride in having strong relationships with my direct team that are built on mutual trust, open communication, agency, and empowerment.

• We win as a team, but I require autonomy to do deep work (and my best work), and similarly am very intent on championing that same autonomy for my team to allow them space to grow and succeed independently in their own craft. 

• I like to understand the ‘why’ behind how things work, to know things deeply, and do them to a high standard. As a lifelong learner, I like to think of myself as a jack (or jill) of all trades. I often use the term sparingly as it’s associated with being a master of none. But through my varied experiences; and having done a bit of nearly ‘everything’ in marketing and then some, I’ve picked up a diverse range of skills, both technical and functional, that help me offer both breadth and depth in the right places. Relatedly, I have developed a high degree of confidence and agility when I approach new and unfamiliar challenges.

• I am strategically minded and pay close attention to how a vision or initiative aligns and fits in with broader goals of the larger organization, as well as adjacent priorities of cross-departmental teams, particularly in tandem with product and sales (and adjacent teams). I value (and drive) thoughtful and considered strategic collaboration and consider that clear goal alignment results in the best shared outcomes.
