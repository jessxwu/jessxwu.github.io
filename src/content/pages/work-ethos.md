I've been thinking about work values a lot these days: how I like to work, my quirks, qualities, hot takes, what I look for in a culture and team.
I have been quite selective about applications, focusing on quality and fit (and what seems exciting to me) over quantity.

I want to be very intentional about the fit this time and more considerate about the long horizon. My Achilles' heel is my ambition though, so maybe I can consider spamming out my resume _(... an experiment, perhaps?)_

I've laid out a few notes on some topics that speak to my work ethos and my most important values. Will be adding to this list as I build this out.

## On Caring and Duty
If I had to encapsulate my approach to work in one phrase: I care deeply (and a lot).
I care about the work that I do, the people I work with, and ultimately in doing my job well (and better than before). It’s important for me to work in a place where the people around me operate with the same commitment of mutual caring and alignment to producing high-calibre work. The day people stop caring, that’s when things start to slip.
I often recall the Stoic teaching, “do your job, do it right”. Seeing work as a duty can seem oppressive, but it can also be very powerful – creating a virtuous cycle of applying consistency and quality in your work, leading to better outcomes every day. This, to me, is the foundation of building and maintaining trust with others, empathy, open communication, and so many other positive externalities.

## On Agency and Intentionality
I fell in love with the concept of agency when I first read about it. It’s always been a driving philosophy for how I steer my own actions, and a valuable concept to apply in both work and life. Adaptability is great. But even better is adaptability + intention. It's about how you design your destiny and carve the path ahead. Maybe agency is another word for free will, not to get philosophical or anything...

## On Leading a Team
As I have high expectations for myself, I also have high expectations for my team. I take pride in having strong relationships with my direct team that are built on mutual trust, open communication, agency, and empowerment.

Ultimately, my approach to leadership is quite simple: I want to see those on my team succeed. It’s a positive adage that you can apply to any team setting. If my team is crushing it, and I am also making my manager’s life easier, then that’s the best barometer to me that I’m doing a good job.

## Emotional Intelligence & Empathy
A follow-up on leadership (feel like most leadership styles are buzzwords anyway). However, I believe the most essential, non-negotiable leadership skill is possessing high emotional intelligence and empathy. I like to consider myself highly empathetic and approachable, and I make it my business to let people know when they’re doing a great job and to praise openly. In upholding the same theme of empathy and trust, people on my team should feel comfortable to and even encouraged to try and fail and have the psychological safety to do so.

## On Autonomy
We win as a team, and I don't want to underscore the importance of teamwork, but I require autonomy to do deep work (and my best work). Similarly I am very intent on championing that same autonomy for my team to allow them space to grow and succeed independently in their own craft.
You better put in those 10,000 hours if you want to be a master of your own work. Nobody gets great without practice and a lot of that time spent is, yes, alone.

## On Being a Renaissance Woman
I like to understand the ‘why’ behind how things work, to know things deeply, and do them to a high standard. As a lifelong learner, I like to think of myself as a jack (or jill) of all trades. I often use the term sparingly as it’s associated with being a master of none – I might prefer ‘renaissance woman’.

But through my varied experiences; and having done a bit of nearly ‘everything’ in marketing and then some, I’ve picked up a diverse range of skills, that I feel help me offer both breadth and depth in the right places. 

One such positive externality of this is that I’ve developed a high degree of confidence and agility when facing new and unfamiliar challenges. I trust in my ability to just ‘figure things out’, even when the path isn’t clear.

## On Passion... Overrated?
I don't need to work in an industry I'm passionate about – and the bulk of my more traditional hobbies are not easily monetisable in ways that are obvious to me. 80,000 Hours writes extensively on this and their literature is very good.  

However, passion can frequently be a stand-in for subject matter expertise. Not a lot of people are passionate about unsexy industries like insurance, or mundane things like laundry detergent. This is indeed valuable, particularly in some domains that do require specialised forms of knowledge. This is ever more salient in certain frontier industries or certain lines of work where innovative new tech and keeping up with new trends can be highly transformative or the basis of your job.

With knowledge comes power and confidence, and I have always been a strong proponent of learning more. This is especially true early in your career, when you are more inexperienced. Being well-informed can help bridge those gaps in understanding. This is where passion may be a bit underrated.

As you get more senior and the role scope is potentially more strategic and nebulous; you realise that having passion doesn’t naturally translate into performance; and it takes some experience to properly wield your passion into useful outcomes. 

I spent years in sports marketing and excelled, despite not being a big sports fan (and that's definitely not something you can fake). What drove me was a commitment to learning and applying myself and doing the job well. I've found that commitment to excellence – caring, duty, and hard work – matters more than passion. However, when passion is present – and only if you are truly very passionate, it provides that extra edge.
