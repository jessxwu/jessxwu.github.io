*I update this page in a sporadic and unceremonious fashion. Last update: 7th Aug 2024.*

**💼 Searching for new hats to wear**  
I'm looking for a new job. I took a 4-month break to travel and see the sights. Now I'm back home, and seeking my next thing.

**🌐 Presenting... the new website**  
My previous site was built off a Jekyll template, and I fell in love with SSG. I decided on Astro.js for this guy.
Currently migrating the content over from my previous blog, and getting some content up.
I'd like to write something documenting my exploratory process, design ethos, and how I built the site with a low-code background.

**🔧 Working on my employable skills**  
Upskilling with digital apps and tools. Learning marketing niches that I'm less familiar with, like SEO. Tinkering with AI a lot and getting comfy with my personal tech stack.

**🧠 Building my second brain and tools for life**  
Separately, I've been spending a lot of time building out my digital Second Brain. It's still disorganised right now and I haven't fully cracked the right process. I'm rethinking how I organise my Notion, Todoist, notes, and document drives. When it's ready, I'd like to move some things to the site.

**🏋️ Spending a lot of time upside down**  
My priority these days is learning new calisthenics skills and I've been working on my handstands a lot, under the guidance of some sweet coaches @ The Rogue Room! Have been changing up how I move. Over the last few years, I've found myself gradually falling into a rhythm of consistency versus intensity, after many periods of burnout. Still doing the regular things: yoga, cycling, running, jump rope, badminton, swimming. 

**🍎 Food**  
I have developed an addition to sugar I haven't been able to curb. Ice cream season has not been helpful, so although I'm happy, my waistline hasn't been. Separately, I have been working on a side project mapping out major cuisines of the world by geography, excited to share that when at a better state of finish. Also have done a lot of mapping of my yummies and places to eat and try on Google Maps.

**🎵 Being a brat**  
I have bought into the charli xcx hype.

**📺 Watching things**  
Stuart and I have been watching Korean horror 'Sweet Home' on Netflix, as well as some sports documentaries recently (Simone Biles, SPRINT, Free Solo). These people are so incredible.
