I am so, so glad I found this band. Rarely do all my favourite genres and sounds come together to make one. Very much like Stereolab (just listen to ‘Acting’), but a lot less French and thus way more comprehensible to me, which is super appreciated. And I’m saying this as a huge Stereolab fan. I’m also a big fan of the harmony of male and female vocalists (many of my favourite bands entertain this concept – Pixies, Beat Happening, Black Tambourine, Air Miami). What a hidden gem. I’ve only listened to You Will Never Know Why, although I hear Velocity: Design: Comfort is their magnum opus. Oh, but YWNKW is so perfect already! When it’s good, it’s flawless. My enthusiasm may be a bit deceptive; there are maybe a few disposable songs, but we can pretend those didn’t happen.

Their lyrics are just adorable. Take ‘Air Supply’ for example: “Girls who spend their lives in disgusting gestures / Always seeking boys to relieve their tension / maybe you know better”. It’s so naïve and cutesy, seemingly high school, but set on this really transcendent and absorbing backdrop of dreamy sound. I love that dichotomy. I can see that it’s not intentional, but to me, it’s all the more endearing because I have a soft spot in my heart for twee. And their voices are lovely. They have that ethereal Elizabeth Gilbert sound, but it’s less soprano, more lo-fi, flatter. Absolute perfection personified.

I can see this becoming favourite album-worthy with time. If I made music, this would be it.
